Implement functions 

float *IntensityProfile(Image *img, int p1, int pn);
void DrawLine(Image *img, int p1, int pn);

in libmo815-3dvis. These functions must return the intensity profile
along a line from voxel p1 to voxel pn, found by 3D linear
interpolation, and substitute the voxels along the line in the image
by the maximum intensity value for that image, respectively.
